### Hi!
I am a Data Scientist, with dreams of applying my data science knowledge and skills to practical urban planning research and improvements, and towards building sustainable â€˜circle economyâ€™-based societies. I am really interested in human-centered data and tech.

This is the place to find all my public projects, from work, school, and personal endeavours.
